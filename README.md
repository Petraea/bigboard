This is a big board project I set up to track remote IP's connecting to my transmission session.
It is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi using pygame and integration into the framebuffer.

It uses an instance of MongoDB to store IP information, and then regreshes the screen with
orthodromes tracking the shortest path between my IP and theirs by air.
There are several other conceptual mapping pieces in here too - wind mapping, hop mapping, etc.
